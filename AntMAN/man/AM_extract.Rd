\title{Extract values within a AM_mcmc_output object.}
\usage{
AM_extract(object, targets, iterations = NULL, debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{\link{AM_mcmc_output}} object}

\item{targets}{List of variables to extract (ie. K, M, mu).}

\item{iterations}{Can specify particular iterations to extracts, NULL for all.}

\item{debug}{Activate log to}
}
\description{
Given an object produced by AM_mcmc_fit, as well as the target variable names,
AM_extract will return a list of the variables of interest.
}
\details{
Due to the complexity of AntMAN outputs, AM_mcmc_output object can be difficult
to handle. The AM_extract function eases access of particular variables within the
AM_mcmc_output object. Variables of varying dimension are expected to result from the transdimensional moves. When considering such
variables, the extracted list would correspond to an nx1 list, where n refers to the number of extracted iterations. Each of these nx1 entries consists
of another list of dimension mx1, where m specifies the number of components inferred for that iteration.
